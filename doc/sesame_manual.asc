= Open Door Lock Manual

This manual describes the installation, setup and usage of the Open Sesame Door System (OSDS).  For technical details of the function of the OSDS please refer to the Technical Manual.

== Installation

This section describes the installation of the OSDS.

=== Parts

==== The system consists of
 - RFID reader x 1
 - Control unit x 1
 - Power supply x 1
 - Backup battery, 12V sealed lead acid x 1
 - Electric door striker
 - Wiring
 - Bluetooth USB dongle

=== Recommended Installation Procedure

After deciding the optimal location for the various elements of the system, it is recommended to install the system in the following order.

==== The Controller unit and backup battery

The controller and backup battery (if used) need to situated conveniently to the user.  The battery is relatively heavy and should be situated on a secure surface.  Most people will want to hide the battery but be aware that cables still need to be connected between the controller and the battery, the door striker and the the card reader.  Do not connect the battery or the powersupply at this stage.

==== Door Striker Plate

Any 12V eceltric striker can be used.  I got mine from Ebay to suit a pre-existing Yale type lock/latch.  Remove the existing door striker and replace with the electric striker.   This will probably involve cutting of the door frame to fit the new plate so some carpentry skills will be required.  Lead and clip the cabling to where the controller is sited.  Ensure that the door can be opened and locked manually using the existing door lock.

Connect the two wires to the correct terminal.  It doesn't matter which way around these are connected.

==== The Card Reader

The card reader was obtained from Ebay and can be any weigand interface type.  It is mounted outside away from the worst of the weather and at a convenient position for people to interact with it using their access cards or fobs.  Multiple card readers are possible.  A hole will need to made in order for the wires to pass through the door frame to the controller.  Push the wire through and seal the hole with a weatherproof sealant.  Seal around the card reader similarly to prevent water ingress.

==== Connecting it all Together

Connect it all together.

== Set up and Testing.

On initial power up no cards are able to open the door, you need to tell the system which cards are able to open the door.  The Master Card is a controller card for the system and is used to add or remove key cards form the system.  You need to first assign a master card as described in the next chapter.  DO NOT LOSE IT!  If it is lost then no new cards can be added to the system and more importantly, no cards can be removed from the system.  This may lead to unauthorised access to the building.  If it is lost then a new master card can be allocated to the system using the procedure described in ...

== Creating a new Master Card

If for some reason a new master card is required it will necessitate a complete wipe of the system losing all the access existing card information.  Existing users of those cards will not be able to gain entry via the OSDS until their cards are re-validated using the new Master Card.

To re-initialise the system switch off the power to the OSDS and while the red and green LEDs are lit during start up, press the manual entry switch.  This will wipe all card data from the system's memory.  Now no card will be able to open the door but don't test this by waving a card past the sensor.  Why will become clear soon.  With the system in this state, the first card presented to the system will become the Master Card.  Any card can be used as the new Master Card and this card will not unlock the door. Mark it with a sharpie.

== Adding Access Cards

The master card will not unlock the door, it is a system control card used to add or remove cards from the system.  To add a card, pass the master card over the card sensor, the LED's will flash alternately.  While the LED's are flashing pass the new card over the sensor.  The flashing will change to indicate that a new card has been added then stop as the system return to normal control mode.  This new card can now be used to open the door.  Don't write the house name on card!  This would give anyone easy access to your building.

== Removing Access Cards

One of the great advantages of the system is that visitors can be given cards to temporarily access the building.  Visitor cards can be created as in the previous paragraph and when those visitors leave, their cards can be removed from the system again thus maintaining the security of the building.

To remove a card pass the master card over the sensor, then when the LED's are flashing pass the visitor's card over the sensor.  The LED's will flash a sequence to indicate the card has been removed.  Test this by attempting to open the door with the newly invalidated card.  It should not unlock.

If they go away with their cards, or people lose their cards you cannot use this method to invalidate a card.  This can be done using the Bluetooth computer or smart-phone interface.  See the section on computer access to the system for further details.

== Security of the System

Even though a part of the system is outside the secured area there is no way that tampering with this component can lead to unauthorised access to the building.  All of the access control is taken care of by the system contained within the controlled area.

== Computer Access Using Bluetooth

The system is able to provide access using a Bluetooth device such as a smart-phone or a computer that has bluetooth capability.  A Blutooth USB device is included in the installation kit.  For how to connect this to your computer see your computer operating manual.  You will need to pair the device with the OSDS in order to access the system.  The PIN to access the system is printed on the packaging.  Make of a note of this and keep it safe.

Once you have paired your device with the OSDS you can now connect to it using either minicom on Linux, hyper-terminal on Windows, something else on a Mac and any of the free terminal applications available for Android or iPhone.

The interface is a simple text screen that, by typing a few single letter commands, allows you to control the OSDS.

=== Command Reference
 - h - Prints out some system information should you need to contact us about it.
 - l - Lists the card numbers present in the system
 - d - Lists the card numbers and asks you which on you want to remove, enter the index number of the card that you want to delete.
 - s - Opens the lock.

Card 0 (zero) is the master card and cannot be removed once programmed other than by a hardware reset.

Beware: The system does not ask "If you are sure..." it just does what you tell it to do so be careful!
