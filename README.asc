= Open Sesame RFID Door System

A RFID and bluetooth door lock using ATmega8 and cheap Wiegand type RFID card reader.

The bluetooth part is in no way secure and needs message encryption, this is my current effort but I never seem to have the time. The BT PIN in set in the HC-06, using the last 4 digits of the "master" card.

== Disclaimer

Don't use this on your door. If you do, I am not responsible if you get robbed. This code is for evaluation only.

== TODO

- Finish encryption for Android <--> lock.
- Add RTC and logging.
- Connect reader LED and use it indicate success
- Connect reader beeper and use it to indicate failure.
- Implement this on a Tiny84

The RFID reader is an ebay item, listed as "Waterproof Door Access Control ID Wiegand 26 RFID Card Reader Security 5-16V"

The connections are:

- (1)Red: VCC Power Anode
- (2)Black: GND Power Cathode
- (3)Green: DATA0 weigand Data Line
- (4)White : DATA1 Weigand Data Line
- (5)Blue:  LED Controlling Line, effective in Low Voltage
- (6)Yellow: Buzzer Control Line, effective in low voltage

Of course you could buy an entire system from China on e-bay cheaper than you can build this system.  Not near so much fun though and probably not as good.
