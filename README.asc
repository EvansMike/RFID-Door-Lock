= Open Sesame RFID Door System

A RFID and bluetooth door lock using Atmega8 or Atmega328 and cheap Wiegand type RFID card reader.

The bluetooth part is in no way secure and needs message encryption, this is my current effort but I never seem to have the time. The BT PIN in set in the HC-06, using the AT+PINXXXX command via serial terminal, before PCB assembly. This is bad too and I am currently working on a better way to achieve this using a PIN derived from the master RFID card. The PIN in the code isn't the real PIN!

== Disclaimer

Don't use this on your door. If you do, I am not responsible if you get robbed. This code is for evaluation only.

== TODO

- Finish encryption for Android <--> lock.
- Add RTC and logging.
- Internet of things? Nooooo.
- Do the BT PIN thing that I keep mentioning.

Of course you could buy an entire system from China on e-bay cheaper than you can build this system. Not near so much fun though.
